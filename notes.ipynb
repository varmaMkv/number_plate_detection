# Number Plate Detection Project

## Overview
This project is focused on detecting number plates from vehicle images using the YOLOv8 model. The project includes steps for preprocessing the data, training the model, and detecting number plates in new images.

## Project Structure
- `datasets/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `runs/`: Directory where the model outputs (e.g., detection results) are saved.
- `detect_number_plate.py`: Script to run the number plate detection on new images.
- `notes.ipynb`: This notebook file with project notes and instructions.
- `number-plate.yaml`: Configuration file for the YOLOv8 model.
- `preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing.
- `training.ipynb`: Notebook for training the YOLOv8 model.
- `yolov8s.pt`: Trained YOLOv8 model weights.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/NumberPlateDetection.git
    cd NumberPlateDetection
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    You can create the `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    opencv-python
    torch
    torchvision
    PyYAML
    ```

## Data Preprocessing
Open `preprocessing.ipynb` to see the steps for preprocessing the dataset, including data cleaning and augmentation.

## Training the Model
Open `training.ipynb` to train the YOLOv8 model on the preprocessed dataset. This notebook contains the code for setting up the model, defining the dataset path, and starting the training process.

## Running Detection
To detect number plates in new images, use the `detect_number_plate.py` script. Update the script with the path to your input images and run:
```sh
python detect_number_plate.py
